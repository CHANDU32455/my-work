Portfolio Chatbot using Gemini | Gen AI Capstone (2025)\n\nThis project showcases a personalized AI chatbot built using Gemini Pro APIs that demonstrates several key Generative AI capabilities:\n\n* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Answers portfolio-specific questions using information retrieved from a vector database.\n* **Function Calling:** Performs real actions by invoking predefined Python functions based on user requests.\n* **Embedding Classification with Keras:** Classifies user intent to provide more relevant and targeted responses.\n\nThis chatbot utilizes tools like **ChromaDB** for vector search, **Gemini Pro** for content generation and understanding, and **Keras** for embedding classification.\n\n🔗 Built for the [Google Generative AI Intensive Capstone

Possessing hands-on experience across a diverse range of technologies including Django, Reactjs, Flask, SQL, Java, and Python, Chandu is adept at building robust and scalable applications.\nDriven by a keen interest in emerging technologies, Chandu is actively exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and the evolving landscape of Web3. This includes a dedicated effort to understand the workflows and technical intricacies related to cryptocurrency, coins, tokens, and blockchain networks. Chandu is eager to leverage his technical skills and growing knowledge in these areas to contribute to innovative and impactful projects.\n---TECHNICAL SKILLS \nChandu has hands-on experience with technologies like Django, React, SQL, and Java.\n---PROJECTS\nIntelligent Virtual Personal Assistant (Python): Developed a functional personal assistant using Python, capable of launching local applications, conducting web searches, and even playing YouTube videos based on user commands. This project showcases strong foundational programming skills and the ability to create practical desktop applications.\nAI-Assisted Todo Application (Dart/Flutter): Explored the Dart programming language and Flutter framework by developing a todo application, leveraging AI concepts during the development process. This highlights a proactive approach to learning new languages and frameworks.\nReal-time E-Bidding Platform (College Laboratory): Designed and implemented an e-bidding system for college laboratory items. The platform facilitates bidding, automatically determines the highest bidder upon timer expiry, and generates winner reports, demonstrating skills in platform development and algorithmic thinking.\nWeb Development Fundamentals: Proficient in front-end technologies with the creation of a responsive Temperature Converter (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).\nDesktop Application Development (Python): Developed several practical desktop applications including a Phonebook with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a Todo List application, and a YouTube Audio/Video Downloader. These projects demonstrate experience with Python GUI libraries and practical application development.\nCustom In-App Keyboard (Python & Reactjs): Designed and implemented a fully functional in-app keyboard as both a standalone Python application and as a reusable component in Reactjs. This highlights versatility in both front-end and back-end development and UI/UX considerations.\nPersonalized Chatbot (Google Workshop): Recently developed a chatbot during a Google workshop designed to answer user queries specifically about Chandu. This demonstrates an ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies in the domain of conversational AI.\nWeb3 Exploration: Currently engaged in understanding and developing within the Web3 ecosystem, focusing on the workflows and technologies associated with cryptocurrencies, coins, tokens, and blockchain networks. This reflects a commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements.\nChandu's diverse project experience showcases a strong aptitude for problem-solving, a dedication to continuous learning, and the ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical and functional applications across various technology stacks. His current exploration into Web3 further underscores his ambition to contribute to the next generation of the internet.\n---INTERNSHIPS AND WORK EXPERIENCE\nChandu has completed internships with Oasis Infobyte and CodSoft, where he worked on web development and Python GUI applications. At CompSci Technology Solutions, he was promoted from Intern to Intern Lead, demonstrating strong leadership and technical abilities.\n---ACHIEVEMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS\nHe’s ranked in the top 1k nationally(704) in TCS CodeVita and has obtained certifications such as NPTEL’s Ethical Hacking, where he explored tools like airmon-ng and Crunch.\n---CODING STYLE AND PREFERENCES\nHe prefers coding in a clean and concise style, avoiding unnecessary comments, and structures code for clarity and performance. Chandu primarily develops on Linux and is comfortable with workflow automation and system-level programming.\n---FUTURE GOALS\nDriven to transition into the IT industry and secure a rewarding role that facilitates a deep understanding of professional workflows and industry best practices.

The chatbot answers general portfolio-related questions by retrieving relevant information from the ChromaDB vector store, demonstrating RAG. See the sections \"Setup ChromaDB for RAG\" and the query examples.\n\n2.  **Function Calling:** The chatbot utilizes function calling to perform specific actions based on user requests. Python functions (`get_educational_background`, `get_contact_information`) are defined and described to the Gemini model, allowing it to generate structured function calls that are then executed. This is demonstrated in the \"Function Calling Setup\" and \"Chatbot Logic with Function Calling\" sections.\n\n3.  **Embedding Classification with Keras:** User queries are classified based on their embeddings using a Keras model to understand the user's intent. This classification helps in potentially routing the query to the appropriate response mechanism or function. The implementation is shown in the \"Embedding Classification Setup\" section.\n\nThis enhanced chatbot architecture effectively integrates Gemini Pro for natural language understanding and generation, ChromaDB for efficient information retrieval, and Keras for intent classification, showcasing a more sophisticated and capable portfolio assistant. This can be further extended with more functions, a larger knowledge base, and a more interactive user interface.","metadata":{}}]}
